## About
Penelope is an organization app built using React Native and Expo. Penelope has various features that aim to help daydreamers keep their lives organized, their thoughts archived, and inspiration quickly accessible.

Try out the application [here](https://expo.dev/@tyreln/penelope-creative-assistant).
## Features

Penelope comes with three tabs each encompassing a feature:

### Reminders:
A tab for setting to-do list items and reminders. To-do list items are just that, and for more time-sensitive cases, you can set your to-do item as a reminder, which allows you to attach a date to it and schedule a notification for the date and time selected.


### Notes
This tab is for jotting down notes and thoughts you would like to keep and be able to find later. You can filter your notes by keywords and phrases to more efficiently find them over time.

### References
A gallery of images queried from the [picsum](https://picsum.photos/) api that can be selected to load a larger version of an image that can be scaled via two-touch pinching and one-touch panned.



## Roadmap for Version 2.0
There are some fundamental improvements planned for 2.0 of Penelope, primarily involving the Notes and References tabs:

- [ ] utilize the [Unsplash API](https://source.unsplash.com/) for timed reference drawings and querying images which can then be multi-selected for a mini-moodboard view.
- [ ] allow notes to be filtered by date (entries before or after a date, or on a certain date)
- [ ] color-code note entries (by some quantifiable metric such as day of the month)
- [ ] allow swiping to delete items in the To-do and Notes tabs

## Additional Notes:
* Penelope has only been tested on android thus far. Additional testing on ios needed.
* Notes and To-Do entries can be deleted by tap-holding them.
