## About
Penelope is an organization app built for ios and android with creatives in mind. Penelope has various features that aim to help daydreamers keep their lives organized with little effort so that they can keep their head in the clouds.
## Features

Penelope comes with three tabs each encompassing a feature:

### To-do list and Reminders:
A tab for typing in items for a to-do list which can be added and just as easily deleted. For more time-sensitive cases, you can set your to-do item as a reminder, which allows you to attach a date to it and schedule a notification for the date and time selected.


### Notes
This tab is for jotting down notes and thoughts you would like to keep and be able to find later. You can filter your notes by keywords and phrases to more efficiently find them over time.

### References
References is a tab for finding pictures queried from the [picsum](https://picsum.photos/) api that can be viewed via pinch-zooming and pan transforms when selected. This tab was designed with artists in mind as a reference tool, but could be helpful for other forms of inspiration as well.



## Roadmap for version 2.0
There are some fundamental improvements planned for 2.0 of Penelope, primarily involving the Notes and References tabs:

- [ ] utilize the [Unsplash API](https://source.unsplash.com/) for timed reference drawings and searching up images with queries
- [ ] allow notes to be filtered by date (entries before or after a date, or on a certain date)
- [ ] color-code note entries (by some quantifiable metric such as day of the month)
- [ ] allow swiping to delete items in the To-do and Notes tabs
